# Privacy Policy — alcoia

> **⚠️ SCAFFOLD ONLY — NOT PUBLISHABLE, NOT A PRIVACY POLICY YET.**
>
> Every section below is a `TODO` for a human. This file exists so the structure and the
> questions are in one place; the answers are not here. Generated privacy text reads
> plausibly and is wrong about actual data flows, which is worse than having no file —
> a policy that misdescribes what the extension does is a false statement to users and to
> the Chrome Web Store, not a formality.
>
> **Do not publish this. Do not link it from the Web Store listing. Do not let an agent
> fill it in.** See `CLAUDE.md` § "Requires human approval".
>
> Chrome Web Store requires a reachable privacy policy URL for any extension requesting
> camera access. This file becoming real is a P0 blocker for shipping.

## 1. Who we are

`TODO(human)` — Legal entity or individual name, jurisdiction of establishment, contact
address, and a working contact email. Required by GDPR Art. 13(1)(a) if any EU user is in
scope.

## 2. What the extension collects

`TODO(human)` — Enumerate, per category, from the code rather than from intent.

Starting points observed in the codebase during the P0 audit. **Each needs verification
before it goes into a published policy — treat these as leads, not findings:**

- Text of the paragraph a reader is on is sent to the backend when an AI response is
  triggered (`POST /api/summarize`). Confirm exactly what fields accompany it.
- Reading-speed baseline and highlight state are persisted via `chrome.storage`. Confirm
  whether that is `storage.local` (device only) or `storage.sync` (replicated through the
  user's Google account) — the answer changes what has to be disclosed.
- **Reader-drawn colour highlights** (`sra_text_highlights`, `chrome.storage.local`, keyed by
  hostname+pathname): the quoted highlighted text, up to 300 characters, plus ~40 characters
  of surrounding page text on each side (stored to re-find the same passage on a later visit)
  and the containing paragraph's index. This is reading content stored on the device — confirm
  it is local-only (item 25 in `CLAUDE.md` found nothing that transmits it) and that this
  predates the quiz below, contrary to an earlier draft of the top-level README's privacy
  section that called the quiz "the first feature that keeps something on disk."
- **AI explanations saved with a highlight** (item 36, same `sra_text_highlights` entries, an
  `explanation` field): opt-in via a separate popup toggle (`sra_highlight_summarize`, off by
  default) — when on, the highlighted text is sent to the backend the same way any other AI
  call in this extension is, and the response is kept locally, capped to 200 characters (shorter
  than what the one-time popup shows), shown on the Highlights page. A fetch that fails is not
  retried, and turning the toggle on does not retroactively generate explanations for highlights
  made before it was on. Confirm the 200-character cap and the local-only storage against
  `src/content/content.js`'s `saveHighlightExplanation()` before this goes in a published policy.
- Webcam frames are processed in-page by WebGazer. Confirm and state plainly that no
  frame, no still image, and no derived image data leaves the device — this is a hard
  invariant in `CLAUDE.md` and should be verifiable by a reader from the network panel.
- Confirm what, if anything, the backend logs — including whether paragraph text appears
  in request logs, and for how long.
- **New as of the quiz feature:** `chrome.storage.local` also now briefly holds selected
  paragraph text (`sra_quiz_pending`) for the one call to generate a quiz's questions, cleared
  once the quiz page reads it. The quiz record itself, in IndexedDB, holds only the generated
  questions (including each one's `span` — a single verbatim sentence cited as the answer's
  evidence, not the paragraph it came from), the reader's chosen answers, and their confidence
  ratings — no paragraph text, no page title, no URL beyond a hostname+pathname key. Confirm
  this against the actual code (`src/content/quiz-store.js`, `src/content/content.js`'s
  `runQuiz()`) before it goes in a published policy, same as every other line here.
- **New as of free-text answer grading (item 43) — a genuinely new data flow, not a variant
  of an existing one, because for the first time something the reader TYPES THEMSELVES, not
  a system-selected passage excerpt, leaves the device.** Two of the four question difficulty
  levels (`free_recall`, `scenario`) accept a typed answer instead of multiple choice; that
  answer text (capped at 500 characters) is sent to the backend (`POST /api/grade`) — along
  with the question's own already-cited `span` and question text, never the surrounding
  paragraph — to be graded, and the verdict it returns is what gets stored locally alongside
  the answer, the same way a multiple-choice `correct`/`incorrect` already is. This happens
  from both the floating question card and the quiz page. A third level (`adversarial`) also
  collects typed free-text but is a deliberate exception: that text is never sent anywhere for
  grading — see `src/content/question-card.js` and `src/popup/quiz.js`, both of which refuse to
  call the grading endpoint for it structurally, not just by convention. Confirm the 500-
  character cap, the field list actually sent, and the adversarial exception against
  `src/shared/grading-client.js` before this goes in a published policy. **Flag this bullet for
  a legal review before publishing** — it is the first place reader-authored prose (as opposed
  to passage text the system itself selected) is transmitted at all.

## 3. What is not collected

`TODO(human)` — State the negatives explicitly, but only the ones actually enforced in
code. An unverified negative claim here is the most dangerous sentence in the document.

## 4. Camera

`TODO(human)` — Cover: camera is off by default and requires explicit opt-in; what gaze
data is derived; that raw gaze coordinates are never persisted or transmitted (aggregates
only); how to revoke; what happens to stored calibration on revocation.

## 5. Third parties

`TODO(human)` — The backend proxies to Groq. Disclose the sub-processor by name, what is
sent to it, where it is processed, its retention policy, and link its terms. Check
whether Groq's current terms permit the intended use and whether they train on submitted
content.

## 6. Legal basis and retention

`TODO(human)` — GDPR Art. 6 basis per processing purpose. Retention period per category.
Deletion mechanism and how a user invokes it.

## 7. User rights

`TODO(human)` — Access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection; how to exercise
each; supervisory authority complaint route.

## 8. Children

`TODO(human)` — Consequential if alcoia is pitched at schools or universities. COPPA
(US, under 13) and any applicable local equivalents. If institutional pilots happen, this
section and a DPA both become blockers, not niceties.

## 9. Changes to this policy

`TODO(human)` — Notification mechanism and effective date.

## Open questions to resolve before writing any of the above

1. Does the backend log request bodies? If yes, paragraph text is retained server-side and
   §2 and §6 must say so.
2. `chrome.storage.local` or `chrome.storage.sync`? Sync means data leaves the device.
3. **The receipt exists now (P4) and needs covering.** Verified behaviour, still to be
   written up by a human: it is built only when the reader presses Alt+I or triggers it
   from the popup; the full contents are shown before any copy, download or sign action;
   it contains a hash of the URL rather than the URL; `auditReceipt()` refuses raw sensor
   fields. The only thing that leaves the device is a signing request the reader clicks,
   which returns the receipt and stores nothing server-side. If receipts are ever shared
   with an institution, that is a disclosure and probably needs a DPA.
4. Is there a paid tier with accounts? Then billing data, auth identifiers, and the
   payment processor all need covering — and `CLAUDE.md` requires human approval for
   anything touching payments or PII.
5. Which jurisdictions are in scope at launch? Determines whether GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA, or
   several apply.
6. **Item 43 (free-text answer grading):** does the backend (or Groq, as its sub-processor —
   see §5) retain the reader-authored answer text sent to `/api/grade`, and for how long? This
   is reader-composed prose, not a passage excerpt the system chose, so the retention answer
   here may need different, more explicit user-facing disclosure than paragraph-text calls get
   — a reader typing their own reasoning is a meaningfully different privacy expectation than
   the system quoting text back at itself. Needs a legal brief before this feature ships
   publicly, not just before this document is published.
