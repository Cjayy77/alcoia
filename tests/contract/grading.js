/* tests/contract/grading.js — VENDORED SNAPSHOT, not shipped source.
 *
 * The API server moved to a separate private repo (see CLAUDE.md, "Migration
 * in progress"). This file is a copy of its pure, dependency-free free-text
 * grading logic (item 43), kept here so the client's assumptions about the
 * grading contract stay under test rather than disappearing silently. Do not
 * import this from shipped code. If this drifts from the server repo's real
 * copy, update it by hand when the contract changes, the same way
 * tests/contract/questions.js already is.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS FILE EXISTS TO SOLVE: reader responses are tier 1 — the
 * only ground truth, given confidence above anything the reading signals can
 * produce (CLAUDE.md, signal hierarchy). That is only justified while
 * grading is deterministic. A model-graded free-text answer would let an
 * LLM's judgement outrank the client's own measurements, and would give the
 * system a way to tell a reader who reasoned correctly that they were wrong
 * — the exact punishment case the invariants exist to prevent.
 *
 * THE RESOLUTION: grading authority degrades as the ladder climbs.
 *   recognition   deterministic, client-side, unchanged — this file is never
 *                 involved.
 *   free_recall   model-graded against the span. The answer IS in the
 *                 passage, so the grader has something concrete to compare
 *                 against. Reduced confidence versus deterministic.
 *   scenario      model-graded, but the answer is NOT in the passage, so
 *                 judgement is genuinely harder. LOWEST confidence. May
 *                 confirm correct; may return unknown. MUST NOT assert
 *                 "wrong" on model judgement alone — enforced in
 *                 validateGradingResponse() below, not left to the prompt's
 *                 wording alone.
 *   adversarial   NOT GRADED, structurally: buildGradingPrompt() and
 *                 validateGradingResponse() both refuse to run for this
 *                 level rather than trusting every call site to remember
 *                 not to call them. There is frequently no single right
 *                 answer to an adversarial challenge — the value is that the
 *                 reader produced the argument. The system responds; it
 *                 does not mark.
 *
 * The asymmetry at scenario is deliberate, not an oversight: a false "you
 * are wrong" delivered to a reader who reasoned well is far more damaging
 * than a missed correction, and it is unrecoverable — they stop trusting
 * the system. Confirm or say nothing, never falsely correct.
