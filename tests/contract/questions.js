/* tests/contract/questions.js — VENDORED SNAPSHOT, not shipped source.
 *
 * The API server moved to a separate private repo (see CLAUDE.md, "Migration
 * in progress"). This file is a copy of its pure, dependency-free question
 * logic, kept here only so the client's assumptions about the server's
 * contract — most importantly, that every question's `span` must appear
 * verbatim in the passage or be rejected — stay under test in this repo
 * rather than disappearing silently. Do not import this from shipped code;
 * the client never authors questions, it only consumes them. If this drifts
 * from the server repo's real copy, that is expected — update it by hand
 * when the contract changes, the same way any other fixture is updated.
 *
 * Original header, preserved for context:
 *
 * Questions, not summaries, are the primary intervention. A summary removes
 * the desirable difficulty that produces retention; a question that the reader
 * has to answer is the only thing in this system that produces ground truth
 * about whether they understood anything.
 *
 * The hard requirement is `span`. Every question must cite the sentence in the
 * passage that contains its answer, verbatim. A model that cannot point at its
 * evidence has invented the question, and an invented question asked of a
 * struggling reader is worse than no question at all. Spans that do not appear
 * in the passage are rejected rather than repaired.
 *
 * Item 42 — level-dependent span validation, added on top of the original
 * header above without weakening anything it promises. Scenario and
 * adversarial questions have answers that are NOT in the passage, by
 * construction — under the original rule alone they could never exist. The
 * span requirement itself does not move: verbatim, present in the passage,
 * mandatory, at every level, no exceptions. What changes is what the span is
 * required to anchor to — see SPAN_ROLE_FOR_LEVEL below. A model that cannot
 * point at real passage text is still rejected at every level; a question
 * whose answer lies outside the passage becomes possible only because the
 * thing it is anchored to lies inside it.
