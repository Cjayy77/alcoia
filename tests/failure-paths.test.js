/* Invariant 9: "Every failure degrades to silence... every one resolves to
 * unknown, and unknown never interrupts. A wrong intervention is worse than
 * a missed one." Stated in CLAUDE.md, previously unguarded by any test.
 *
 * This file covers the failure paths that live in exported, importable
 * modules: question-card.js's defence against malformed question shapes,
 * and state-engine.js's resolution of unrecognised or absent reading signals to
 * `unknown`. Two of the paths in this item's brief cannot be unit-tested
 * this way and are covered elsewhere instead:
 *
 *   - Server unreachable / 422 / malformed response from the questions
 *     endpoint, and PDF/PPTX extraction failure: both live inside
 *     content.js's handleAsk() and triggerAIForParagraph(), which are not
 *     exported — content.js is a single non-modular IIFE, not an ES module.
 *     tests/browser/smoke.mjs's `FAIL=questions` mode exercises the real
 *     network-failure path end to end instead: the mock server returns a
 *     422 for every /api/questions call, and the run asserts the endpoint
 *     was actually hit, no question card ever reached the screen, and no
 *     page error was thrown. PDF/PPTX extraction failure is now wrapped in
 *     try/catch in content.js (falls through to the existing empty-text
 *     return), but verifying the PDF/PPTX pipeline itself is item 20's
 *     dedicated audit, not this one's.
 *   - Missing or invalid install token: there is no token mechanism in the
 *     client yet (see item 9 in the build brief). Nothing to test here
 *     until it lands.
 *   - Storage read failure: chrome.storage.local.get's callback contract
 *     always receives an object, even on error (chrome.runtime.lastError is
 *     set separately) — so `chrome.storage.local.get(DEFAULTS, cb)` already
 *     degrades to the supplied defaults by construction, not by any code in
 *     this repository that could be unit-tested in isolation.
 *
 * Also confirms decisions dropped downstream never spend the interruption
 * budget, which is the other half of "degrades to silence" — a failure that
 * silently burned one of the reader's handful of interruptions would be its
 * own defect.
