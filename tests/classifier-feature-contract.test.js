/* The guard CLAUDE.md asked for, as a contract rather than a memory.
 *
 * THE TRAP: classifier.js is a generated tree of `<=` comparisons, and
 * `undefined <= 30` is false rather than an error. Remove a feature from the
 * extractor without regenerating the tree and nothing crashes — the classifier
 * routes down one branch forever and keeps emitting confident labels. The
 * browser check would still print plausible states, because printing plausible
 * states IS the failure mode.
 *
 * So no test that merely runs the classifier can catch this. This one reads
 * both files and compares the set the tree branches on against the set the
 * extractor actually emits. Delete a feature and this fails immediately, with
 * the name of the feature, before anything reaches a reader.
 *
 * If you are here because this test is failing: you removed a key from the
 * extractor. Retrain in `tldr classifier/tldr_classifier_training(1).ipynb`
 * against the reduced feature set, regenerate classifier.js, and only then
 * change the extractor. Do not "fix" this test by deleting the assertion.
