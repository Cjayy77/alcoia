alcoia is a browser extension that notices when you are struggling with a page and offers help
with that specific passage.

It does this by watching **how you read** — how fast you move through a paragraph compared with
how dense that paragraph is and how fast you normally read, whether you scroll back to re-read
something, whether you select or copy text, whether you leave the tab. None of that needs a
permission prompt, and none of it needs a camera.

When something looks off, it does not summarise at you. It **asks you a question** about the
passage you just read, with the sentence containing the answer quoted underneath. Answering is
the only thing in the system that produces ground truth: getting it right ends the interruption,
getting it wrong is when an explanation appears.

There is an optional webcam mode. It is **off by default**, it contributes only whether you are
at the screen and roughly which region you are looking at, and video never leaves your machine.

## The signal hierarchy

Three sources, in order of authority. This ordering is the product, not an implementation detail.

1. **Reader responses** — answers to retrieval questions. The only ground truth here. An answer
   outranks anything the sensors say. A correct answer resolves to `on_pace` and stops the system
   pressing; a dismissal asserts nothing at all, because declining to be tested says nothing
   about comprehension.
2. **Browser telemetry** — reading rate against text difficulty and your own baseline, scroll
   regressions, selection, copy, blur, idle. Precise, always available, no permission needed.
   **This is the primary path and the default.**
3. **Webcam gaze** — coarse presence and region only. Around 180 px of error, which is several
   lines of text. It may assert only that you are `absent`, or corroborate a state telemetry
   already suspects. It can never assert a reading state on its own.

## Reading states

Six, and every one of them names an **observation**, not a feeling:

`on_pace` · `skimming` · `struggling` · `drifting` · `absent` · `unknown`

There is deliberately no `confused` and no `overloaded`. Those are internal states that cannot be
measured from a browser, and claiming to detect them would be claiming something the software
cannot support. `unknown` is a valid, correct and common answer — nothing ever interrupts on it.

## Interruption policy

Reader attention is the scarcest resource in this product, and a wrong interruption is worse than
a missed one.

- At most one interruption every 3 minutes
- At most five per session
- Never twice on the same paragraph
- Never on `unknown`
- Every interruption carries visible evidence — "You slowed down a lot here" — which turns an
  inference into an observation the reader can check

## The reading receipt

Press `Alt+I` and alcoia builds a record of what you covered and what you actually recalled. It
is built on your machine, you see the whole thing before it goes anywhere, and nothing is ever
submitted in the background.

It can be signed. **A valid signature means the receipt is unaltered since the server issued
it — nothing more.** It is not evidence that the reading happened: the figures come from your own
browser. That caveat is a field of the artifact itself, so it travels with the file.

The recall block is the substance. Coverage alone records that pages were scrolled through, which
is not evidence of reading and is trivial to fake — so when nothing was answered, the panel says
so in those words.

## Languages

Word and sentence counting goes through `Intl.Segmenter`, so the pace signals work in scripts
that do not put spaces between words — Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Khmer, Lao, Burmese — as well as
in space-delimited ones. Sentence splitting handles the Arabic question mark, the Urdu full stop
and the Devanagari danda, not only ASCII punctuation. Difficulty falls back to sentence and
clause structure where Flesch-Kincaid does not apply, with per-script anchors so ordinary prose
in Arabic or Chinese is not scored as unusually dense.

Reading-rate baselines are kept per language.

## Privacy

- The camera is **off by default**, and the service worker independently refuses to start it
  unless the reader turned it on — so nothing can start a webcam by posting a message.
- **No video, image or webcam frame is ever transmitted.** Verified by an automated browser test
  that inspects every outbound request body.
- **No raw gaze coordinates** are stored or transmitted. Aggregates only.
- **No analytics, no telemetry-to-vendor, no crash reporting, no third-party fonts or scripts.**
  Verified: zero third-party requests in the browser test.
- **There is no covert mode**, and there will not be one. Not behind a flag, not for an
  institution, not for testing.

Passage text **is** sent to a server to generate questions and explanations. That is the one
thing that leaves your machine, and it is stated here rather than buried.

## On accuracy

**No real-participant evaluation has been performed, and no accuracy figure for this project
should be treated as meaningful.**

The classifier that ships in `alcoia/src/content/classifier.js` was trained on synthetic data:
rows generated from hand-written rules, then duplicated with Gaussian noise and split randomly —
so a row's noisy twin can sit in the test set while the original sits in training. The figure in
that file's header is kept for provenance, with that context attached. It is not a claim about
how well this extension detects anything.

Earlier drafts of this README carried an 88% figure and a "75–82% real-world" estimate. Both are
gone. The second was never measured against anything at all.

That classifier is also no longer on the critical path: it runs only when the camera is on, which
is not the default.

## Install

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd alcoia
npm install          # tooling only; the extension itself ships unbundled
```

Then load `alcoia/` as an unpacked extension at `chrome://extensions` with Developer mode on.

The backend (question generation, explanations, receipt signing) lives in `alcoia/server/`. See
[`alcoia/README.md`](alcoia/README.md) for the full setup, keyboard shortcuts and configuration
reference.

## Verify

```bash
npm run lint                    # ESLint — a defect linter, not a style linter
npm test                        # 242 tests
npm run test:browser            # loads the extension in Chromium, English article
PAGE=zh npm run test:browser    # same checklist against a Chinese article
```

The browser check asserts the things that matter and that unit tests cannot see: that the content
script injects with no page errors, that **zero** `getUserMedia` calls happen with the camera off,
that no image or video data appears in any request, that no third-party request is made, that the
overlay stylesheet actually reaches its elements, and that every keyboard shortcut still fires.

## Licence

The extension client is **AGPL-3.0**. It bundles WebGazer, which is **GPLv3**, so the shipped
package is a combined copyleft work: the complete corresponding source must be offered to anyone
who receives it, and the client can never be closed-source while WebGazer ships inside it.

Fonts (Literata, Plus Jakarta Sans) are **SIL OFL 1.1**, with their licences alongside the
binaries. `alcoia/server/` is **not** covered by the AGPL grant. Details in
[`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md).
