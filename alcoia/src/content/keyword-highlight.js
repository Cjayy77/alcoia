/* keyword-highlight.js — load-bearing terms in a post-failure explanation
 *
 * Only on the failure path: after a wrong answer, on the explanation text
 * itself. Never in the question, never in the options, never in the quoted
 * span (that is the passage, verbatim, and highlighting it would blur the
 * line between "the system's own emphasis" and "words already in the
 * source text") — CLAUDE.md's `--alc-sage` is reserved for moments the
 * system itself produced, and a correct answer never reaches this module
 * at all (see item 12: confirmation only, no explanation, no highlighting).
 *
 * Term selection is a client-side heuristic, not a server field. The
 * question/explanation contract (tests/contract/questions.js) has no
 * "key terms" field, and adding one would be a server change — out of
 * scope here. So this picks candidates itself: the longest, least common
 * words in the explanation, skipping short function words. It is a
 * heuristic, not linguistics — good enough to draw the eye to two or three
 * substantive words, not a claim about which words actually matter most.
 *
 * The regex only matches Latin-ish letters, so a CJK/Thai/etc. explanation
 * naturally yields no candidates and no highlighting — degrading to
 * nothing rather than guessing at word boundaries a naive regex cannot
 * find in an unspaced script (the same invariant-5 instinct as everywhere
 * else in this codebase: no signal beats a wrong one).
 *
 * Highlighting wraps matches in the ALREADY-ESCAPED HTML string — it never
 * interprets anything the model returned as markup. The only tags this
 * file ever introduces are its own literal `<span class="sra-term">`.
