/* response-signals.js — what the reader actually answered
 *
 * Top of the signal hierarchy, and the only ground truth in the system.
 * Everything else infers comprehension from behaviour; this observes it.
 * A wrong answer is not evidence that someone is probably struggling — it is
 * a reader failing to retrieve something they just read.
 *
 * So these outrank every telemetry signal in the engine, and a correct answer
 * is as informative as a wrong one: it says the slow reading that triggered
 * the question was fine, and the system should stop pressing.
 *
 * The auxiliary measures — how long they took, whether they changed their
 * mind, whether they scrolled back to look — are recorded for the receipt.
 * None of them are used to override the answer itself.
