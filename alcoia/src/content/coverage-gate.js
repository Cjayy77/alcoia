/* coverage-gate.js — the one function that decides "read enough to test"
 *
 * The quiz is offered at the end of reading and is triggerable from the
 * popup, and both must read the same threshold from the same place — if
 * they diverge, the end-of-reading overlay says ready while the popup
 * button says no (CLAUDE.md, "The quiz — decided"). `evaluate()` below is
 * that one place; item 16 wires it to both surfaces and must not grow a
 * second copy of this decision.
 *
 * Gated on coverage AND dwell, never on scroll position. Coverage alone —
 * "the reader scrolled past every paragraph" — is trivially fakeable in
 * seconds and is exactly the gap receipt.js's own header already warns
 * about ("Coverage without recall says only that a page was scrolled
 * past"). Requiring a minimum measured dwell time alongside it is what
 * keeps a fast scroll-to-bottom from reading as "done".
 *
 * Gated on accumulated coverage for the DOCUMENT, not the visit: reading
 * half today and half tomorrow reaches the threshold tomorrow, the same
 * way the existing session-continuity toast survives leaving and
 * returning. It is NOT built on top of that toast's storage, though —
 * saveLastVisit()/checkLastVisit() in content.js key on
 * `window.location.href`, the *entire* URL including the query string, so
 * a `?utm_source=` appended to a shared link resets it. This module needs
 * to survive exactly that case, so it defines its own key — see
 * documentKey() — rather than inheriting one that would silently defeat
 * the "robust to query strings" requirement.
