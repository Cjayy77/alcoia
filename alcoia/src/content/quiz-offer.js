/* quiz-offer.js — end-of-reading trigger for the *unprompted* quiz offer
 *
 * Separate from coverage-gate.js on purpose: coverage-gate.js's evaluate()
 * answers "has enough of this document been read", and is shared by every
 * caller that needs that answer — this file, the popup's quiz button, and
 * eventually the quiz page itself, all read the same threshold from that
 * one function so they cannot disagree (CLAUDE.md, "The quiz — decided").
 *
 * This file answers a narrower, second question specific to the unprompted
 * card: has the reader scrolled to the end, and has this document already
 * had its one offer. Reader-initiated paths (the popup button) never call
 * this — CLAUDE.md: "The end-of-page offer is shown at most once per
 * document and is dismissible" is a rule about the offer, not about the
 * quiz itself, and the popup button has no such limit.
 *
 * Reader-initiated, so it spends no interruption budget: this module never
 * touches intervention-policy.js, and the offer it triggers is not a
 * question — nothing here calls response-signals.js either.
