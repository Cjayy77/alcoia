/* snooze.js — an explicit, reader-chosen pause on interruptions
 *
 * Worth having before any inferred tolerance adaptation: it is explicit,
 * cheap, honest, and it produces a signal no inference engine will produce
 * better. A reader who snoozes constantly is telling you something directly.
 *
 * What it does and does not touch:
 *   - Suppresses the final render step only (content.js's onIntervention).
 *   - Detection, coverage tracking and the quiz gate all keep running —
 *     turning those off would mean the quiz gate never opens for a reader
 *     who reads with reminders snoozed, which is a worse outcome than a
 *     paused interruption.
 *   - Never auto-renews. A snooze that silently re-arms itself is not the
 *     reader's decision anymore, it is the product's, wearing the reader's
 *     choice as cover.
 *   - Persisted in chrome.storage.local, so it does survive a browser
 *     restart — CLAUDE.md's "no silent persistence across restarts" is
 *     satisfied by always showing the true remaining time wherever this is
 *     displayed (the popup, the confirmation toast), never a stale label.
