/* intervention-policy.js — decides whether a reading state earns an interruption
 *
 * The engine says what it observed. This says whether to act on it. Splitting
 * the two matters: it means the budget is enforced in one place instead of
 * being spread across a classifier loop and a scroll handler that never knew
 * about each other.
 *
 * Rules are from CLAUDE.md and are not tunable at runtime:
 *   - at most one interruption per 3 minutes
 *   - at most five per session
 *   - never twice on the same paragraph
 *   - never on `unknown`
 *
 * A wrong interruption costs more than a missed one. When in doubt, decline.

 * `ask` is a retrieval question about the passage. It is the primary
 * intervention, not a summary: summarising removes the desirable difficulty
 * that produces retention, and an answer is the only thing in this system that

 * the renderer also falls back to it when no question can be generated for a
 * passage — see `handleAsk` in content.js. */
