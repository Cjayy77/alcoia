/* session.js — the paid-tier magic-link session (item S3)
 *
 * Mirrors install-token.js's shape and reasoning closely — read that file's
 * own header first. Same "issued, not derived, opaque, hashed server-side"
 * credential model (SERVER-ARCHITECTURE.md §4), same injectable
 * storage/fetchImpl for testing without a real chrome/fetch global. What's
 * different, and why this file is NOT loaded the way install-token.js is:
 *
 * - install-token.js is loaded via loadModule() — a dynamic import() —
 *   which content SCRIPTS can do and service workers cannot ("import() is
 *   disallowed on ServiceWorkerGlobalScope by the HTML specification").
 *   That's exactly why install-token.js lives where dynamic import() works
 *   and hands background.js a resolved string instead of being loaded
 *   there directly.
 * - Here the same constraint bites harder. The one-time CODE this module's
 *   exchangeCode() consumes can ONLY ever be received by background.js's
 *   own chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal listener — content scripts and
 *   extension pages cannot receive that event at all, a Chrome platform
 *   fact, not a design choice (see manifests/base.json's
 *   externally_connectable and background.js's own listener). So the one
 *   place the exchange call structurally has to run is the one place that
 *   cannot import this file, dynamically OR statically — background.js's
 *   service worker carries no `"type": "module"` (manifests/chrome.json),
 *   by design, so it can keep loading via plain importScripts() the same
 *   way Firefox's background.scripts array works (see build.mjs's own
 *   header on why the two targets do not share more than they do).
 *
 * exchangeCode() below is still exported and still fully unit-tested
 * (tests/session.test.js) — it is the CANONICAL, verified definition of
 * what a correct exchange does: validate the response shape, never trust a
 * session token that doesn't come back looking exactly right, store the
 * result, never silently retry a rejected code. background.js's own
 * onMessageExternal listener mirrors this exact shape by hand, out of
 * necessity, not carelessness — see that file's own comment at the point it
 * does, and tests/background-session.test.js, which exercises that copy
 * directly rather than assuming the mirroring held. If this function's
 * behaviour ever changes, that listener needs the same change made by
 * hand; there is no import to make it automatic, which is the one real
 * cost of the platform constraint above.
 *
 * requestMagicLink() has no such constraint — it runs from wherever the
 * sign-in screen lives (src/popup/account.js, a real ES module extension
 * page), which can call this directly, the same way any other extension
 * page reaches the backend.
 *
 * getSession()'s job is "is there a valid session RIGHT NOW", never "does
 * a key exist in storage" — a stale or locally-expired entry reads as
 * signed-out and is cleared as a side effect of being read. This is a
 * self-heal, not the real gate: the server is what actually enforces
 * expiry on the next authenticated call (CLAUDE.md: "the client never
 * decides entitlement"). Every paid-feature check in this codebase must
 * call getSession() (or something that itself calls it), never read
 * sra_session out of storage directly and treat presence as truth.
