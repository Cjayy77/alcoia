/* config.js — the one place the backend origin is defined.
 *
 * Loaded as a plain classic script (not an ES module) into all three
 * contexts that used to hardcode this separately: the content script
 * (manifests/base.json content_scripts.js, listed before content.js),
 * the background service worker (background.js, via importScripts on
 * Chrome; manifests/firefox.json's background.scripts array on Firefox),
 * and the popup (popup.html, before popup.js). Every context shares a
 * `self` — window in the popup and content script, WorkerGlobalScope in
 * the Chrome service worker — so attaching to `self` reaches all three
 * without needing a module system any of them actually has.
 *
 * No production origin has been assigned yet. BACKEND_ORIGIN below is a
 * placeholder on the reserved `.invalid` TLD (RFC 2606) so it fails DNS
 * cleanly instead of silently resolving somewhere unintended — replace it
 * with the real deployed origin before any public release.
 *
 * A developer running a local backend does not need to edit this file or
 * the manifest: open the popup's Settings and set "Backend URL" (stored as
 * sra_backend_url), which overrides this default at runtime. See
 * README.md's "Running the Backend Server" section.
 *
 * Item S3 (magic-link sign-in) is the one exception to "no edit needed" —
 * WEB_APP_ORIGIN below feeds a runtime origin check in background.js, but
 * it also has to exactly match a SEPARATE, static value in
 * manifests/base.json's `externally_connectable.matches` (JSON, cannot
 * import this file, cannot be overridden at runtime the way Backend URL
 * can) — see build.mjs's own comment on that manifest entry for the full
 * reasoning. A developer testing sign-in locally against a differently-
 * ported alcoiaWeb needs to edit BOTH this constant AND that manifest
 * entry, by hand, together.
