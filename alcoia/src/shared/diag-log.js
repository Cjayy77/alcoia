/* diag-log.js — a short, local-only record of what silently failed
 *
 * Every failure in this extension degrades to silence for the reader
 * (invariant 9) — no error toast, no broken card, just nothing happening.
 * That is correct for the reading experience, but it means a reader whose
 * AI calls are quietly failing (a stale token, a network block, a server
 * outage) has no way to tell "nothing to interrupt about" apart from
 * "something is broken" — and neither does whoever is helping them. The
 * diagnostics page (src/popup/diagnostics.html) is the one place that
 * silence becomes visible again, on request.
 *
 * Deliberately not a general-purpose logger: entries are a fixed
 * {at, context, message} shape, context is a short internal tag
 * ('summarize' | 'apiPost' | ...), and message is sanitised — any
 * http(s) URL is stripped before it is ever written to storage. This file
 * must never be handed passage text, a page title, or a page URL to log;
 * callers only pass short technical strings ('no_install_token',
 * 'status_500', an exception's .message). Local-only, capped, never
 * transmitted — the same local-persistence-is-not-level-C reasoning as the
 * quiz record (CLAUDE.md, statefulness).
