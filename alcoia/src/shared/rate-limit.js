/* rate-limit.js — tiny in-memory burst+ceiling limiter (item 43)
 *
 * Extracted out of host.js's own checkAiCallBudget() so a second context
 * with its own module instance — quiz.js, a normal extension page, not
 * sharing host.js's closure — can give its own AI calls the same "bug
 * backstop, not security control" shape (CLAUDE.md, item 38) without
 * re-deriving the burst/ceiling math by hand. Each caller that constructs
 * one gets its own independent counters, same as host.js's own
 * aiCallTimestampsByPath always has — this adds no shared state across
 * contexts and enforces nothing a determined caller couldn't bypass by
 * reloading the page; it exists to catch bugs, not attackers.
 *
 * host.js's own checkAiCallBudget() is left as its own inline copy rather
 * than rewritten to call this — it is already covered by host.test.js and
 * carries no reuse need of its own; this module exists for the one new
 * caller (quiz.js) that does.
