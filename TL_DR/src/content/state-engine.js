/* state-engine.js — single reading-state estimate for TL;DR
 *
 * Replaces the two independent pipelines that each fired their own popups:
 * comprehension-monitor (telemetry) and the gaze classifier. Both now feed
 * this engine, which produces one state, and only that state drives
 * interventions. See intervention-policy.js for what happens next.
 *
 * The signal hierarchy from CLAUDE.md is enforced structurally, not by
 * convention:
 *
 *   telemetry  → may assert any actionable state
 *   gaze       → may assert ONLY presence/absence, and may corroborate a
 *                telemetry state to raise confidence. It can never, on its
 *                own, claim a reader is struggling.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole point. Webcam gaze carries ~180px of error;
 * it knows roughly where someone is looking and whether anyone is there.
 * It does not know whether they understood the paragraph.
 *
 * `unknown` is the default and a correct, common answer. The engine never
 * substitutes a plausible-looking state for missing data.
